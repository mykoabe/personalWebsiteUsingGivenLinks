           <li>
               I read many philosophical and novel books for my general knowledge. some of them if I wanted to list
               some of them include aliweledim, dem bedem, yaltenore liginet, kedit wede matu, efoyita,
               keaddimas bashager, haddis, yanna mastawesh and many other books are intersestedme.
           </li>
           <li>In the next two years I am going to read many books from novel to academic books because books
               are the one which gives strength and flexibility to our mind like food gives to all other parts of 
               the body. so reading books is the best way to increase our mindset. Reading is not for anly for 
               colege examinations but we must read all the time. having a good grade in colege is not like having
               great knowlege about that subject.
               .</li>
           <li>
                   As I read books and magazines and any other written material I waw also have time
                   for playing and taking time with friends. I play football at the weekend and basket 
                   ball every day at the morning. sometimes we play table tennis with my friends. playing 
                   football gives me a good recreation than every thing. when I feel depresed I went to play 
                   table tennis.
